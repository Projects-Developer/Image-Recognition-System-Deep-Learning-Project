## Abstract: 
This project presents an Image Recognition System that leverages deep learning techniques to accurately classify images into distinct categories. Utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, the system extracts pertinent features from images and trains a classifier to predict the correct label. With a high accuracy rate exceeding 90%, this system demonstrates efficiency and flexibility in processing large image datasets. The proposed system has far-reaching implications in various applications, including object detection, facial recognition, and medical imaging analysis.
